3D Camera Class

This class was provides common camera functions for moving around in 3D space via quaternions.  

These use the actual quaternion math (instead of building DirectX and OpenGL functions which are likely faster
than what I have provided).

Future modifications should include replacing sin with sinf functions for using floats consistently.
